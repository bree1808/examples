/* Write a C function, writeData(char *name, float *x, int N),
which writes the first N elements of the array pointed to by x to a file as ASCII text
data (ie: use the %f format specifier in fprintf()). Each element should be written
to a new line. The file name is passed as the string pointed to by name.
Your function must open the file with fopen(), write the data with fprintf(),
then close the file with fclose(). It does not need to perform any error handling.
The function prototypes for the functions above are:
FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode);
int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
int fclose(FILE *stream);
