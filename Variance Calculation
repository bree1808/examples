/*Write a C program which reads four numbers and outputs their sample variance.
 *Given that N = 4 (and some algebra) Equation 3 can be expanded into two steps:
 *1. Calculate the sample mean: mean = 1/4 × (X1 + X2 + X3 + X4)
 *2. Calculate the variance: var = 1/3×((X1−mean)^2+(X2−mean)^2+(X3−mean)^2+(X4−mean)^2)
 *Your program will have to declare four float variables to store the four input values.
