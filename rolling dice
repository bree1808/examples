//Using the rand(); function, write a C program which estimates the probability that, when two
//dice are thrown, at least one of the dice rolled a 3. This can be done with the following algorithm:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int counter = 0;
    int aThreeHappened = 0;
    while(counter < 1000)
    {
        a = 1 + rand() % 6;
        b = 1 + rand() % 6;
        
        if (a == 3 || b == 3)
        {
            aThreeHappened = aThreeHappened + 1;
        }
    
        counter = counter + 1;
    }
    answer = aThreehappened / counter;
